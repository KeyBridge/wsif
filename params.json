Other\r\nlanguages and IDEs have their own schema binding compiler. e.g. xsd.exe for .NET,\r\nXSD for C++, etc. Search for 'data binding compiler' to find a version in your\r\nlanguage of interest.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Content</td>\r\n    <td>Location</td>\r\n    <td>License</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Rest Client: Jersey</td>\r\n    <td>com.keybridgeglobal.api.rest.client.jersey</td>\r\n    <td>GPL 3.0</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Rest Client: Scribe</td>\r\n    <td>com.keybridgeglobal.api.rest.client.scribe</td>\r\n    <td>GPL 3.0</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Class Library: WSIF</td>\r\n    <td>com.keybridgeglobal.wsif</td>\r\n    <td>GPL 3.0</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Class Library: Scribe</td>\r\n    <td>org.scribe</td>\r\n    <td>MIT</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## References / Requires:\r\n[Jersey]: http://jersey.java.net/ \r\nJersey is the open source, production quality, JAX-RS (JSR 311) Reference Implementation for building RESTful Web services.\r\n\r\nCommons Codec: http://commons.apache.org/codec/  \r\nApache Commons Codec&trade; software provides implementations of common encoders and decoders such as Base64, Hex, Phonetic and URLs.\r\n\r\nScribe-Java: https://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java\r\nScribe is a mature OAuth library for Java by Pablo Fernandez that is intended to work with all APIs.\r\n\r\n## GNU General Public License\r\n> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n> This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
