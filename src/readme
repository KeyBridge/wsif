History:

This package contains three sample web client implementations and supporting
class library software.

Also included is the logical data model schema file (XSD) and a data file (XML)
containing sample query/response messages.

You may compile your own complete WSIF class library with the XSD file or use
the included Java sample, which is pre-built for you.

To build your own WSIF library in Java use the 'xjc' compiler command. Other
languages and IDEs have their own schema binding compiler. e.g. xsd.exe for .NET,
XSD for C++, etc. Search for 'data binding compiler' to find a version in your
language of interest.
